# Portfolio
This file showcases the first project of my CS 210 class where we were tasked with creating a clock that allows users to 
adjust the time and automattically updates by 1 second everytime the user makes a change or views the clock. In regards to 
what I did well, I would say I did well with storing values, keeping the loop active, and taking user input. To enhance my 
code I would have added in options to adjust the time based off of time zones. While this adjustment would not do much 
to make the code more efficienct I believe it would make the result of the code more useful. As far as what was most 
challenging to write I would have to say the code to make the time auto update while the user is also making changes to the 
displayed time. Just about evert skill used in the project were used throughout the rest of the course as this project largely
covered what I would call the basics of C++. I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by leaving clear notes 
on what each section of code accomplished, used proper spacing, and ensured that code could easily be added to make any 
further improvements or adjustments to the code. 

The second file in the repository is my completed software design document. This document covers the gaming room client Draw It or Lose It. This project was to make recommendations on making the game playable on multiple operating systems, specifically Mac, Windows, Linux, mobile, and the possibility for others like xbox and playstation. I feel that for this project I covered the available resources and the strengths of the various systems well. When developing the code, I felt that having this plan very helpful as it allowed me to keep the end result in my mind, and helped me make steps early in the process to ease my path to finishing the project. The needs of the user were rather simple for this project. The user needed to be able to have quick access to the updating images as they appeared on the screen and needed to be able to give a quick answer when ready to make guesses on what was being depicted as the goal of the gamer was to guess what the image was of before a set time limit. 

The third and fourth files in the repository showcase a business requirements document and a system deisng document. These cover the DriverPass project, a new software that allows new drivers to pracitce both online and in person to better prepare for their driving tests. This software gives students access to online quizzes, courses, and even allows them to book real driving lessons with a trained instructor. I believe that my prowess for this project was better showcased on the buisiness side of this project, when looking back over the two documents I find that the former paints a much clearer picture of what is expected as the end result of this project. The users needs were met to the best of my ability in this project, and are always something important to keep in mind when doing any sort of programming project. In this case, the user needed to be able to access their relevant content, create, edit, and cancel driving lessons, and be able to view progress and content from any device. When desigining software I find it important to begin with an outline covering the various sections or requirements of the software I am desigining then working through checking off each box as I go ensuring that each of the clients needs are met as efficeintly as possible. 

The Contact and Contact Service files are a testament to ensuring that code is functional and secure. This was acheived through rigourous static and dynamic testing testing both the code line by line and as a whole with inputs. User needs are crucial to the success of a program and ensuring that we as programmers get paid. The best way to intererpet them in my opinion is to create a checklist when having your one on one conversation with the client and then ensuring that by the time the program is complete the checklist has been completed as well. Using the checklist as a guidebook towards the final goal of the program. I try to incorporate that into my approach to desiging my software, I also try to prioritize efficiency when I program, I strive to create code that has as little unused code as possible.

# Portfolio
This file showcases the first project of my CS 210 class where we were tasked with creating a clock that allows users to 
adjust the time and automattically updates by 1 second everytime the user makes a change or views the clock. In regards to 
what I did well, I would say I did well with storing values, keeping the loop active, and taking user input. To enhance my 
code I would have added in options to adjust the time based off of time zones. While this adjustment would not do much 
to make the code more efficienct I believe it would make the result of the code more useful. As far as what was most 
challenging to write I would have to say the code to make the time auto update while the user is also making changes to the 
displayed time. Just about evert skill used in the project were used throughout the rest of the course as this project largely
covered what I would call the basics of C++. I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by leaving clear notes 
on what each section of code accomplished, used proper spacing, and ensured that code could easily be added to make any 
further improvements or adjustments to the code. 

The second file in the repository is my completed software design document. This document covers the gaming room client Draw It or Lose It. This project was to make recommendations on making the game playable on multiple operating systems, specifically Mac, Windows, Linux, mobile, and the possibility for others like xbox and playstation. I feel that for this project I covered the available resources and the strengths of the various systems well. When developing the code, I felt that having this plan very helpful as it allowed me to keep the end result in my mind, and helped me make steps early in the process to ease my path to finishing the project. The needs of the user were rather simple for this project. The user needed to be able to have quick access to the updating images as they appeared on the screen and needed to be able to give a quick answer when ready to make guesses on what was being depicted as the goal of the gamer was to guess what the image was of before a set time limit.

# Portfolio
This file showcases the first project of my CS 210 class where we were tasked with creating a clock that allows users to 
adjust the time and automattically updates by 1 second everytime the user makes a change or views the clock. In regards to 
what I did well, I would say I did well with storing values, keeping the loop active, and taking user input. To enhance my 
code I would have added in options to adjust the time based off of time zones. While this adjustment would not do much 
to make the code more efficienct I believe it would make the result of the code more useful. As far as what was most 
challenging to write I would have to say the code to make the time auto update while the user is also making changes to the 
displayed time. Just about evert skill used in the project were used throughout the rest of the course as this project largely
covered what I would call the basics of C++. I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by leaving clear notes 
on what each section of code accomplished, used proper spacing, and ensured that code could easily be added to make any 
further improvements or adjustments to the code. 

The second file in the repository is my completed software design document. This document covers the gaming room client Draw It or Lose It. This project was to make recommendations on making the game playable on multiple operating systems, specifically Mac, Windows, Linux, mobile, and the possibility for others like xbox and playstation. I feel that for this project I covered the available resources and the strengths of the various systems well. When developing the code, I felt that having this plan very helpful as it allowed me to keep the end result in my mind, and helped me make steps early in the process to ease my path to finishing the project. The needs of the user were rather simple for this project. The user needed to be able to have quick access to the updating images as they appeared on the screen and needed to be able to give a quick answer when ready to make guesses on what was being depicted as the goal of the gamer was to guess what the image was of before a set time limit. 

The third and fourth files in the repository showcase a business requirements document and a system deisng document. These cover the DriverPass project, a new software that allows new drivers to pracitce both online and in person to better prepare for their driving tests. This software gives students access to online quizzes, courses, and even allows them to book real driving lessons with a trained instructor. I believe that my prowess for this project was better showcased on the buisiness side of this project, when looking back over the two documents I find that the former paints a much clearer picture of what is expected as the end result of this project. The users needs were met to the best of my ability in this project, and are always something important to keep in mind when doing any sort of programming project. In this case, the user needed to be able to access their relevant content, create, edit, and cancel driving lessons, and be able to view progress and content from any device. When desigining software I find it important to begin with an outline covering the various sections or requirements of the software I am desigining then working through checking off each box as I go ensuring that each of the clients needs are met as efficeintly as possible. 

The Contact and Contact Service files are a testament to ensuring that code is functional and secure. This was acheived through rigourous static and dynamic testing testing both the code line by line and as a whole with inputs. User needs are crucial to the success of a program and ensuring that we as programmers get paid. The best way to intererpet them in my opinion is to create a checklist when having your one on one conversation with the client and then ensuring that by the time the program is complete the checklist has been completed as well. Using the checklist as a guidebook towards the final goal of the program. I try to incorporate that into my approach to desiging my software, I also try to prioritize efficiency when I program, I strive to create code that has as little unused code as possible. 

This Portfolio now includes a ZIP of my 3D Scene I created. Before beginning this course my only experience with 3D Modeling is experiencing a finished project through video games. Now I have a strong understand of how those cutting edge scenes are made, and hope to one day work on video games myself putting what I have just learned to good use. I found it extremely benefitial when working on a project like this one within 3D to slow down, put in the extra time to ensure that the first side of my shape is completely accurate and using the best practices that I have access to, then using that first side as a guide for the remaining sides of the shape. This project gave me a much stronger appreciation for the fine detail work of coding, whereas before a small error was relateivly easily identifiable because the program would not run or the result would be wildly different than what was expected. For this project accuracy was measured through what seemed to be the most accurate within the scene or fine tuning the objects withtin the scene to make the scene as appealing as possible. 

This portfolio now includes a full recommendation for a mock scenario from a company hoping to reinforce their security software. This was my first foray into software security and really opened my eyes as before when I had no idea about the wide variety of options out there to create a secure software. While this scenario allowed for the simple implementation of SHA-256 as it allowed for quick encrption in a quick manner. 

For this course I studied Emerging Systems covering implementing code to a hardware board. One of the files added shows a basic knowledge of the coding to provide an example of what this sort of work looks like when implemented. The second file shows the code in action, causing the lights on the board to flash different words in morse code. I believe that for these projects I was able to test, and avoid syntax errors very well. However when it came to troubleshooting issues that were not plain to the eye I struggled to solve the issues. After this course I will definitely be adding the Texas Instruments CCS to my tool bet for the future. The skills that will easily transfer from this project will be the constant testing, ensuring that the program still functions after every few lines of code. As always to make the code as readable and adaptable as possible it is cruical to use notes within the code explaning the different sections, as well as avoiding incredibly specific variables that would conflict with any other projects. 

The app development project I worked on helps users track and manage events in a simple, user-friendly way. It allows users to log, edit, and view events, set reminders, and stay organized with clean, intuitive navigation. I approached coding by breaking the project into smaller components, focusing on key features first, and testing each part as I built it. Through testing and user feedback, I was able to refine the experience and catch minor issues. The main challenge was balancing flexibility with simplicity, but the event reminder and notification system became the most successful part of the project, demonstrating my ability to create functional and user-friendly features.


The latest additions to this portfolio cover the culmination of my work in CS340 at SNHU. 
This course has taught me to adjust how I code to be more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I have done this by creating more comments as I work, and but checking my work more often as I am coding rather than waiting until the end to check for mistakes. Working this way has had a major impact on the time spent to code as I can identify problems and fix them right away rather than digging through a mountain of issues to finally get to usable code. After this course I have changed how I approach problems as a computer scientist to think more about the customer. The customer for our projects in this course has very specific requirements for all of the work and those requirements served as a guiding light throughout the project making sure that everything matched how the customer wanted everything to be handled. We were also asked in this course, what is it that computer scientists do and why they matter. Through this course we were taksed with various assignments that provided a small fictional animal shelter the means to have an updateable public database to easily find good homes for a wide variety of pets. Wihtout computer scientists, they would have essentially been reliant on word of mouth and not been able to effectively keep track of the large number of pets in their care.

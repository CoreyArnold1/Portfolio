This file showcases the first project of my CS 210 class where we were tasked with creating a clock that allows users to 
adjust the time and automattically updates by 1 second everytime the user makes a change or views the clock. In regards to 
what I did well, I would say I did well with storing values, keeping the loop active, and taking user input. To enhance my 
code I would have added in options to adjust the time based off of time zones. While this adjustment would not do much 
to make the code more efficienct I believe it would make the result of the code more useful. As far as what was most 
challenging to write I would have to say the code to make the time auto update while the user is also making changes to the 
displayed time. Just about evert skill used in the project were used throughout the rest of the course as this project largely
covered what I would call the basics of C++. I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by leaving clear notes 
on what each section of code accomplished, used proper spacing, and ensured that code could easily be added to make any 
further improvements or adjustments to the code.
